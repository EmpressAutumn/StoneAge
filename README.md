Stone age is minecraft 1.14.4 mod that gives you feeling of man from stone age. No more magically created planks from wood logs, the way to first crafting table is long and dangerous. In prehistoric ages, animals was not domesticated and same apply to this mod. There are no cows/sheeps/pigs/chickens, but their ancestors aurochs/mouflons/boars/fowls which are quit upset when you attack them or their friends.
